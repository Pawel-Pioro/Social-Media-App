# Social-Media-App

This is a social-network full-stack website that I created where users can communicate with others. Users can view posts, create an account, follow users which will display all of their posts in a 'following' section, like and unlike posts, view profiles of users which will show all of their posts and their following/follower count and they can create and edit posts. The backend is made in django where I created an API for my javascript frontend to consume. The posts are stored in a sqlite database. I created the whole project start to finish and it taught me many valuable skills like filtering a large number of data and displaying that data depending on the wanted outcome.
