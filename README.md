# Social-Media-App

This is a social-network full-stack website that I created where users can communicate with others. The backend is made in Django where I created an API for my JavaScript frontend to consume. The posts are stored in a SQLite database.

## Features
- User Auth 
- Users can view posts and like and unlike them
- The ability to follow users which will display all of their posts in a 'following' section
- View profiles of users which will show all of their posts and their following/follower count
- Create and edit posts.

I created the whole project start to finish and it taught me many valuable skills like filtering a large number of data and displaying that data depending on the wanted outcome.
